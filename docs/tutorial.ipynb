    "## Getting started ##\n",
    "First, you need to install SOS and make it available in your system path. This is best done using the `pip` (or `pip3`) command of your Python distribution. If you don't have Python installed, do so using your system's package manager or by downloading and installing it from `https://www.python.org/downloads/` or, e.g., `https://conda.io/miniconda.html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing SOS through pip works like the following code, but take into account\n",
    "- the `!` is not part of what you would write on the command line;\n",
    "- the installation might require admin rights;\n",
    "- reload this notebook after successful installation):"
