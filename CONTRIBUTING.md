# Development and Contribution #

You are very welcome to contribute, fix bugs, and augment SOS by missing features! Please ask for assignment of an issue and send in your pull requests against `master`. This project uses trunk-based development for the same reason SOS was originally developed - it's much more natural than feature- and release-branching and simply does what most developers want - regularly saves current development state to the VCS.
Note that SOS is currently developed using a private SVN repository which gets mirrored from time to time to Github.
